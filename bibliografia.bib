abstract = {Visual connection to nature has been demonstrated to have a positive impact on attention restoration, stress reduction, and overall health and well-being. Inside buildings, windows are the primary means of providing a connection to the outdoors, and nature views even through a window may have similar effects on the occupants. Given that humans recognize environments through multi-sensory integration, a window view may also affect occupants’ thermal perception. We assessed the influence of having a window with a view on thermal and emotional responses as well as on cognitive performance. We conducted a randomized crossover laboratory experiment with 86 participants, in spaces with and without windows. The chamber kept the air and window surface temperature at 28 °C, a slightly warm condition. The outcome measures consisted of subjective evaluations (e.g., thermal perception, emotion), skin temperature measurements and cognitive performance tests. In the space with versus without windows, the thermal sensation was significantly cooler (0.3 thermal sensation vote; equivalent to 0.74 °C lower), and 12% more participants were thermally comfortable. Positive emotions (e.g., happy, satisfied) were higher and negative emotions (e.g., sad, drowsy) were lower for the participants in the window versus the windowless condition. Working memory and the ability to concentrate were higher for participants in the space with versus without windows, but there were no significant differences in short-term memory, planning, and creativity performance. Considering the multiple effects of window access, providing a window with a view in a workplace is important for the comfort, emotion, and working memory and concentration of occupants.}

abstract = {Mean radiant temperature is central to our understanding of the radiant heat exchange between the human body and surrounding environment. This paper will present a review of the concept's evolution including its qualitative definition, methods of quantitative evaluation and corresponding challenges. In the process, this review suggests that more effort needs to be invested in addressing the geometric complexities of radiant heat transfer in research into MRT; the ASHRAE definition is broad and is liable to simplification, and research which uses the definition relies on a variety of simplifications, often without acknowledging the degree of geometric complexity which exists in reality. Existing means of obtaining an estimate of mean radiant temperature range from direct measurements using globe thermometers or net radiometers, to computational simulations, and are widely used for studies within indoor and outdoor environments. Previous literature studying the correlation between air temperature and MRT has found equivalence ratios, the relative importance of convection to radiation, ranging from 0.71 to 1.4, however, it is often assumed to be 1.0 in current research practices. We also identified a rapid increase in the usage of MRT in biometeorological studies during the last ten years on top of the increased usage in indoor environment sensing and modeling in light of recent developments in heating and cooling systems. Recent efforts to include the short-wave component in indoor MRT characterization have shown an increase in cooling capacity of radiant floors from 32 to 110 W/m2; significantly decreasing peak energy demand.}

ABSTRACT = {This study addresses solar energy applications in protected agriculture, focusing on greenhouses and related technologies. A bibliometric and technical analysis is developed, covering research published between 1976 and 2024, to identify the main trends and challenges in the use of solar energy in controlled environments. The methodology was based on the PRISMA approach, using the Scopus database to retrieve relevant documents. From an initial total of 221 documents, 216 were selected after a filtering and debugging process, ensuring the relevance of the final set. In the analytical phase, the results showed a moderate growth of 3.68% in the annual publication rate, highlighting the impact of research on solar energy’s application to air conditioning and energy efficiency in greenhouses. Most of the studies reviewed feature hybrid systems that combine solar energy with other resources, and we highlight both advances in climate control through artificial intelligence and the implementation of photovoltaic and thermal technologies to improve the energy efficiency of agricultural systems. The results also underline the importance of tomato cultivation in the selected studies, reflecting its global economic impact. The conclusions highlight the need for the further integration of energy storage and desalination technologies, especially in arid regions with high solar irradiation, to ensure the sustainability of greenhouses. It is proposed that future research should address the wider implementation of hybrid systems and advanced climate control technologies, optimizing both the use of energy resources and the performance of crops under cover. In addition, it is recommended that international collaboration be strengthened to address technical and climatic challenges in protected agriculture and to expand the adoption of innovative solutions in different geographical contexts.},

abstract = {This study assessed the climate conditions inside a greenhouse in which 50% of the roof area was replaced with photovoltaic (PV) modules, describing the solar radiation distribution and the variability of temperature and humidity. The effects of shading from the PV array on crop productivity were described on tomato, also integrating the natural radiation with supplementary lighting powered by PV energy. Experiments were performed inside an east–west oriented greenhouse (total area of 960m2), where the south-oriented roofs were completely covered with multi-crystalline silicon PV modules, with a total rated power of 68kWp. The PV system reduced the availability of solar radiation inside the greenhouse by 64%, compared to the situation without PV system (2684MJm−2 on yearly basis). The solar radiation distribution followed a north–south gradient, with more solar energy on the sidewalls and decreasing towards the center of the span, except in winter, where it was similar in all plant rows. The reduction under the plastic and PV covers was respectively 46% and 82% on yearly basis. Only a 18% reduction was observed on the plant rows farthest from the PV cover of the span. The supplementary lighting, powered without exceeding the energy produced by the PV array, was not enough to affect the crop production, whose revenue was lower than the cost for heating and lighting. The distribution of the solar radiation observed is useful for choosing the most suitable crops and for designing PV greenhouses with the attitude for both energy and crop production.}

Las quemaduras solares, la inmunodepresión, el fotoenvejecimiento y la fotocarcinogénesis son algunos de los efectos adversos más importantes de la radiación solar en el ser humano. Los niños son un grupo poblacional de especial vulnerabilidad debido a que en ellos la exposición solar tiene efectos biológicos más pronunciados en comparación con los adultos. Por otro lado, la infancia es un periodo crítico para promover el desarrollo de fotodaño y fotocarcinogénesis en etapas más tardías de la vida si no se ponen las medidas adecuadas, ya que se estima que entre los 18 y 20 años de edad se recibe del 40-50% de la exposición acumulativa a la radiación ultravioleta hasta la edad de 60 años. La estrategia más importante para la fotoprotección de los niños son las modificaciones de comportamiento y hábitos relacionados con la exposición al sol a todos los niveles (colegio, sociedad, familia, etc.). El recurso de la sombra, la reducción del tiempo global de exposición al sol y la protección física (ropa, sombreros y gafas de sol) representan las mejores y menos costosas estrategias de fotoprotección. Los fotoprotectores deben incorporarse a la rutina diaria de los niños, de la misma manera que los adultos, y deben cumplir una serie de requisitos que los hagan eficaces, seguros y comprometidos con el medio ambiente.
Sunburn, immunodepression, photoaging, and photocarcinogenesis, are some of the most significant adverse effects of solar radiation in humans. Children are population group of special vulnerability, due to the fact that exposure to the sun has more pronounced biological effects compared to adults. Furthermore, childhood is a critical period for promoting the development of photo damage and photocarcinogenesis in the later stages of life if adequate measures at not put into place. This is because it is estimated that between 18 and 20 years of age is when 40% to 50% of the accumulative exposure to ultraviolet radiation up to 60 years of age is received. The most important strategy for the photoprotection of children is changes in behaviour and habits associated with exposure to the sun at all levels (school, society, family, etc.). Resorting to the shade, reduction in overall time of exposure to the sun, and physical protection (clothes, hats, and sunglasses) are the best and least costly photoprotection strategies. The photoprotectors must be incorporated into the daily routine of children in the same way as adults, and must complete a series of requirements in order to make them effective, safe, and in line with the environment.}

abstract = {The global expansion of solar photovoltaics (PV) is central to the global energy transition. As governments aim to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030, solar PV is poised for rapid growth, particularly outside mid-latitude regions (China, Europe, US) where uptake has been highest. These new growth areas have diverse environmental conditions, where factors like higher temperatures and aerosol concentrations strongly impact solar power production. A comprehensive review of these effects therefore aids PV performance and siting optimization. This review examines six key influences: solar irradiance, ambient temperature, atmospheric conditions, terrain effects, extreme weather events, and long-term irradiance changes. First, solar irradiance has strong geographic and temporal variability, making it the most significant factor. Second, raising module temperature reduces efficiency by 0.4–0.5 % per degree Celsius, limiting productivity in hotter climates. Third, atmospheric conditions (clouds, aerosols, pollutants, and dust) can reduce electricity output by up to 60 %, especially in desert regions. Fourth, terrain factors like albedo and snow present mixed effects, with increased reflection boosting output but snow obstructing panels. Fifth, extreme weather like wildfires and hailstorms cause substantial damage, while solar eclipses lead to large but short-lived output losses. Finally, long-term changes in solar irradiance, driven by climate change and air pollutants, present future challenges for maintaining PV efficiency. Optimizing PV systems for diverse climates and mitigating environmental impacts on productivity is important to the continued success of solar photovoltaics. This review highlights the need for tailored strategies to maintain performance in varied and evolving environmental contexts.}

abstract = {Rooftop photovoltaic (PV) power generation is an important form of solar energy development, especially in rural areas where there is a large quantity of idle rural building roofs. Existing methods to estimate the spatial distribution of PV power generation potential are either unable to obtain spatial information or are too expensive to be applied in rural areas. Herein, we propose a novel approach to estimate the spatial distribution of the general potential of rural rooftop power from publicly available satellite images. We divide rural building roofs into three categories based on their orientation and roof angle and propose a revised U-Net deep learning network to extract roof images from satellite images at the macro level. Based on the rooftop detection, a calculation method for the potential area of the installed PV panel at the micro level was developed, considering different types of PV panels and their maintenance methods. By combining the above results and setting the solar radiation parameters and PV system efficiency, we can obtain the spatial distribution of the rooftop PV power generation potential in rural areas. This method is applied in northern China on a village and a town scale, and the overall accuracy of the revised U-Net model can reach over 92%. The spatial distribution information was analyzed and displayed. The annual average PV power generation potential ranges from 26.5 to 36.2 MWh per household and from 7.3 to 10 GWh per village.}

abstract = {The present study evaluates ground-based downward surface shortwave radiation (Rs) over the coastal region of Alicante (Southeastern Spain). Hourly measurements collected over the eleven-year period 2010-2020 are used. Two weather stations located over the region capital, Alicante, have been selected as representative of urban and suburban typologies. Two additional weather stations far from the city have been selected representing rural typologies. Rs is significantly reduced over the urban station during the morning hours within the winter season compared to the observations recorded over the suburban and rural stations, with a global mean difference of -81 and -120 W/m2 at 10 LT, respectively. However, no significant differences are obtained during the midday sun, with a global mean difference of -20 W/m2 between the urban and rural stations. With the aim of explaining these differences, the current paper investigates the relationship between Rs and different air pollutants: NOx, SO2, and fine particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) as well as the wind field measured at the urban and suburban stations. The results found in this work point towards a close relationship between Rs and NOx concentrations annual cycles, which are also influenced by the prevailing wind circulations observed over the study area. A global mean NOx concentration of 107 µg/m3 is observed over the urban station at 10 LT during the winter season. In contrast, these high concentrations are significantly reduced over the suburban station, with global mean value of 40 µg/m3 at 10 LT, for this period of the year.}

ABSTRACT={Ground-received solar radiation is affected by several meteorological and air pollution factors. Previous studies have mainly focused on the effects of meteorological factors on solar radiation, but research on the influence of air pollutants is limited. Therefore, this study aimed to analyse the effects of air pollution characteristics on solar radiation. Meteorological data, air quality index (AQI) data, and data on the concentrations of six air pollutants (O3, CO, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, and NO2) in nine cities in China were considered for analysis. A city model (model-C) based on the data of each city and a unified model (model-U) based on national data were established, and the key pollutants under these conditions were identified. Correlation analysis was performed between each pollutant and the daily global solar radiation. The correlation between O3 and daily global solar radiation was the highest (r=0.575), while that between SO2 and daily global solar radiation was the lowest. Further, AQI and solar radiation were negatively correlated, while some pollution components (e.g., O3) were positively correlated with the daily global solar radiation. Different key pollutants affected the solar radiation in each city. In Shenyang and Guangzhou, the driving effect of particles on the daily global solar radiation was stronger than that of pollutants. However, there were no key pollutants in Shanghai. Furthermore, the prediction performance of model-U was not as good as that of model-C. The model-U showed a good performance for Urumqi (R2=0.803), while the difference between the two models was not particularly significant in other areas. This study provides significant insights to improve the accuracy of regional solar radiation prediction and fill the gap regarding the absence of long-term solar radiation monitoring data in some areas.}

abstract = {Abstract The primary driver of the climate system is the uneven distribution of incoming and outgoing radiation on earth. The incoming radiant energy is transformed into various forms (internal heat, potential energy, latent energy, and kinetic energy), moved around in various ways primarily by the atmosphere and oceans, stored and sequestered in the ocean, land, and ice components of the climate system, and ultimately radiated back to space as infrared radiation. The requirement for an equilibrium climate mandates a balance between the incoming and outgoing radiation, and further mandates that the flows of energy are systematic. These drive the weather systems in the atmosphere, currents in the ocean, and fundamentally determine the climate. Values are provided for the seasonal uptake and release of heat by the oceans that substantially moderate the climate in maritime regions. In the atmosphere, the poleward transports are brought about mainly by large-scale overturning, including the Hadley circulation in low latitudes, and baroclinic storms in the extratropics, but the seamless nature of the transports on about monthly time-scales indicates a fundamental link between the two rather different mechanisms. The flows of energy can be perturbed, causing climate change. This article provides an overview of the flows of energy, its transformations, transports, uptake, storage and release, and the processes involved. The focus is on the region 60°N to 60°S, and results are presented for the solstitial seasons and their differences to highlight the annual cycle. Challenges in better determining the surface heat balance and its changes with time are discussed. Copyright © 2004 Royal Meteorological Society},

The relation is τ= ao+a1ek/cos z where z is the zenith angle of the sun. The constant a0, a1 and k are functions only of altitude and of haze model (visibility range).

Este modelo simple podría ser capaz, combinándolo con registros de heliofanía o nubosidad y generalizaciones que cubran la radiación difusa, de predecir la insolación para su uso en optimización de diseños.
Résumé
La ransmittance d'une atmosphère standard 1962, pour le rayonnement solaire de toutes longueurs d'onde parvenant par jour clair sur une surface à l'altitude A, est trouvé correspondre à un modèle simple de mélange de gaz gris (1 noir, 1 gris, 1 clair) avec une erreur maximum de 0,4%. La relation est: τ= ao+a1ek/cos z où z est l'angle zénithal du soleil. Les constantes a0, a1 et k, sont seulement fonction de l'altitude et du modèle de brume (domaine de visibilité) On tient compte de l'effet de quatre climats types (tropical, été et hiver en latitude moyenne, été subartique) en modifiant les trois constantes par des rapports qui dépendent seulement du type de climat (et non de l'altitude et du modèle de brume) et qui se situent entre 0,92 et 1,04. Ce modèle simple devrait être susceptible d'être combiné avec les enregistrements d'ensoleillement et de nébulosité, ainsi qu'avec des généralisations comportant le rayonnement diffus, pour permettre des prédictions d'ensoleillement utilisables dans l'optimisation des concepts.}

For these determinations, it is necessary to have, either from actual measurements or estimates, a knowledge of the total (direct plus diffuse) radiation on a horizontal surface-its measurement is now regularly made at 98 localities in the United States and Canada. For localities where only an estimate of the long term average total radiation is available, relationships presented in this paper can be utilized to determine the statistical distribution of the daily total radiation at these localities.}

Examination of the several published values of a and b shows that a is related linearly, and b is related hyperbolically, to the appropriate mean value of n/N. Use of these relationships to establish values of a and b results in a formula which provides more accurate estimates of radiation from sunshine data than by the extrapolated use of existing formulae.}

ABSTRACT = {On the analysis of solar radiation and meteorological variables measured in Ankara province in Türkiye from 2017 to 2018, an empirical model of global solar radiation was developed. The global solar radiation at the ground and at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) was calculated and in good agreement with the observations. This model was applied to compute the losses of global solar radiation in the atmosphere and the contributions by atmospheric absorbing and scattering substances. The loss of global solar radiation in the atmosphere was dominated by the absorbing substances. The sensitivity test showed that global solar radiation was more sensitive to changes in scattering (described by a scattering factor S/G, S and G are diffuse and global solar radiation, respectively) than to changes in absorption. This empirical model was applied to calculate the albedos at the TOA and the surface. In 2017, 2018, and 2019, the computed albedos were 28.8%, 27.8%, and 28.2% at the TOA and 21.6%, 22.1%, and 21.9% at the surface, which were in reasonable agreement with satellite retrievals. The empirical model is a useful tool for studying global solar radiation and the multiple interactions between solar energy and atmospheric substances. The comparisons of global solar radiation and its loss in the atmosphere, as well as meteorological parameters, were made at some representative sites on the Earth. Some internal relationships (between G and the absorbing and scattering substances, air temperature and atmospheric substances, air temperature increase and latitude, etc.) were found. Thus, it is suggested to thoroughly study solar radiation, atmospheric substances, and climate change as a whole system and reduce the direct emissions of all atmospheric substances and, subsequently, secondary products (e.g., CO2 and non-CO2) in the atmosphere for the achievement of slowing down climate warming.},

Mediante un muestreo estratificado con la altitud se definieron 200 puntos de cálculo. Los métodos de cálculo utilizados fueron: método de día claro de Hottel, H. C. -para altitudes inferiores a 2500 m.s.n.m- y de día claro de Page -para altitudes superiores a dicha cota-. Se compararon dos métodos de mapeo: interpolación y análisis de correlaciones y regresiones con variables topográficas y de ubicación. La radiación total para día medio, presenta una alta correlación lineal con la altitud y entre meses, por lo que conviene estimar este parámetro para el mapeo, mediante la aplicación de ecuaciones de regresión.},

This contribution evaluates the impact of instrument uncertainties contributing to data inaccuracies and their effect on short-term and long-term measurement series, and on radiation model validation studies. For the latter part, transposition (horizontal-to-tilt) models are used as an example. Confirming previous studies, it is found that a widely used pyranometer strongly underestimates diffuse and global radiation, particularly in winter, unless appropriate corrective measures are taken. Other types of measurement problems are also discussed, such as those involved in the indirect determination of direct or diffuse irradiance, and in shadowband correction methods. The sensitivity of the predictions from transposition models to inaccuracies in input radiation data is demonstrated. Caution is therefore issued to the whole community regarding drawing detailed conclusions about solar radiation data without due attention to the data quality issues only recently identified.}

abstract = {Various approaches to the calculation of solar radiation at the earth's surface using satellite data are reviewed. The methods range from qualitative and subjective use of hard copy satellite images at low spatial and temporal resolution to the use of high resolution digital data and spectral radiative transfer models. Operational techniques are also described. These can be either statistically or theoretically based with varying degrees of numerical complexity. The nature of the input data requirements also varies. Some methods use widely available hard copy satellite images while others are based on digital data. There is also a wide variation in the requirements for additional environmental data. Some models meet all such requirements by analysis of the satellite data. Other models need such information as precipitable water derived from upper air soundings or empirical calculations. The accuracy of various models is assessed. Accuracy increases dramatically with averaging period (hourly to monthly). Many models, even some of the more easily implemented ones, are able to match the accuracy of the models which use surface based observations of cloud or bright sunshine.}

The term “site adaptation” has recently started to be used in the framework of solar energy projects to refer to the improvement that can be achieved in satellite-derived solar irradiance and model data when short-term local ground measurements are used to correct systematic errors and bias in the original dataset. This contribution presents a preliminary survey of different possible techniques that can improve long-term satellite-derived and model-derived solar radiation data through the use of short-term on-site ground measurements. The possible approaches that are reported here may be applied in different ways, depending on the origin and characteristics of the uncertainties in the modeled data.

Time series of solar irradiance components that spans decades can be supplied by satellite-derived irradiance or by reanalysis models, with very various types of uncertainty associated to the specific approaches taken and quality of boundary conditions information. In order to improve the reliability of these modeled datasets, comparison with ground measurements over a short period of time can be used for correcting some aspects, bias mainly, of the modeled data by using different methodologies; this procedure is known as site adaptation. Therefore, a benchmarking exercise that uses different site adaptation techniques was proposed within the Task 16 IEA-PVPS activities. In this work, over ten different site-adaptation techniques have been used for assessing the accuracy improvement, using ten different datasets covering both satellite-derived and reanalysis solar radiation data. The effectiveness of these methods is found not universal or spatially homogeneous, but in general, it can be stated that significant improvements can be achieved eventually in most sites and datasets.}

ABSTRACT = {Downward shortwave radiation (DSR) to the Earth’s surface is an essential renewable energy component. Accurate knowledge of solar radiation, i.e., solar energy resource assessment, is a prior requirement for the development of the solar energy industry. In the framework of solar resource assessment, site adaptation refers to leveraging short-term, high-quality ground-based observations as unbiased references to correct long-term, site-specific gridded model datasets, which has been playing an important role in this research area. This study evaluates 12 probabilistic site adaptation (PSA) methods for the correction of the hourly DSR data from multiple gridded DSR products in the Western Sichuan Plateau (WSP). Surface pyranometer observations are used as the reference to adapt predictions from two satellite products and two reanalysis products, collectively. Systematic quantification reveals inherent errors with root mean square errors (RMSEs) > 200 W/m2 across all datasets. Through a comparative evaluation of three methodological categories (benchmarking, parametric/non-parametric, and quantile combination approaches), it is demonstrated that quantile-based ensemble methods achieve superior performance. The median ensemble (MED) method delivers optimal error reduction (RMSE: 163.97 W/m2, nRMSE: 34.43%). The resulting optimal dataset, with a temporal resolution of 1 h and a spatial resolution of 0.05° × 0.05°, identifies the WSP as a region of exceptional energy potential, characterized by substantial annual total solar radiation (1593.10 kWh/m2/yr) and a stable temporal distribution (negative correlation between the total solar radiation and the coefficient of variation). This methodological framework provides actionable insights for solar resource optimization in complex terrains.},

ABSTRACT = {The adaptation of modeled solar radiation data with coincident ground measurements has become a standard practice of the industry, typically requested by financial institutions in the detailed solar resource assessments of solar projects. This practice mitigates the risk of solar projects, enhancing the adente solar plant design and reducing the uncertainty of its yield estimates. This work presents a procedure for improving the accuracy of modeled solar irradiance series through site-adaptation with coincident ground-based measurements relying on the use of a regression preprocessing followed by an empirical quantile mapping (eQM) correction. It was tested at nine sites in a wide range of latitudes and climates, resulting in significant improvements of statistical indicators of dispersion, distribution similarity and overall performance: relative bias is reduced on average from −1.8% and −2.3% to 0.1% and 0.3% for GHI and DNI, respectively; relative root mean square deviation is reduced on average from 17.9% and 34.9% to 14.6% and 29.8% for GHI and DNI, respectively; the distribution similarity is also improved after the site-adaptation (KSI is 3.5 and 3.9 times lower for GHI and DNI at hourly scale, respectively). The methodology is freely available as supplementary material and downloadable as R-package from SiteAdapt.},

However, both the reanalyses and the satellite-based estimates can be severely biased, especially in high latitude regions. In this study, surface solar irradiance estimates from the ECMWF Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) and the Cloud, Albedo, Radiation dataset Edition 2 (CLARA-A2) were used as input to a random forest regression (RFR) model to construct a novel dataset with higher accuracy and precision than the input datasets. For daily averages of global horizontal irradiance (GHI) at Norwegian sites, CLARA-A2 and ERA5 respectively produced a root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of 17.9 Wm−2 and 27.1 Wm−2, a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 11.9 Wm−2 and 17.5 Wm−2, and a bias of −1.5 Wm−2 and 4.3 Wm−2. In contrast, the proposed regression model provided an RMSD of 16.2 Wm−2, an MAD of 10.8 Wm−2, and a bias of 0.0 Wm−2. This shows that the RFR model is both accurate and precise, and significantly reduces both dispersion and bias in the new dataset with respect to the constituent sources. A sky-stratification analysis was performed and it was found that the proposed model provides better estimates under all sky conditions with particular improvements in intermediate-cloudy conditions. The proposed regression model was also tested on five Swedish locations and it was found to improve surface solar irradiance estimates to a similar degree as for the Norwegian locations, thus proving its consistency under similar climatic conditions.}

Solar irradiance and environmental data are provided by satellite and in-situ measurements. It is usual that satellite measurements present high temporal resolution with limited spatial resolution, and in-situ measurements provide high accuracy but significant missing data. This paper proposes a methodology based on machine learning algorithms that: i) takes the best of both data sources to obtain an improved spatio-temporal resolution, known as site-adaptation; and ii) provides highly accurate forecasting solar-radiation models based on deep learning on the improved data. Through a study case with real data, we show the benefits of using the proposed methodology based on machine and deep learning techniques to integrate data from different sources and to construct precise solar radiation forecasting models in regions where solar energy systems are required. Results show that machine learning models for site-adaptation performed up to 38% better than traditional methods.}

We use three different Artificial Neural Networks techniques to forecast tourist demand: a multi-layer perceptron, a radial basis function and an Elman neural network. The structure of the networks is based on a multiple-input multiple-output setting (i.e. all countries are forecasted simultaneously). We use official statistical data of inbound international tourism demand to Catalonia (Spain) and compare the forecasting accuracy of four processing methods for the input vector of the networks: levels, growth rates, seasonally adjusted levels and seasonally adjusted growth rates. When comparing the forecasting accuracy of the different inputs for each visitor market and for different forecasting horizons, we obtain significantly better forecasts with levels than with growth rates. We also find that seasonally adjusted series significantly improve the forecasting performance of the networks, which hints at the significance of deseasonalizing the time series when using neural networks with forecasting purposes. These results reveal that, when using seasonal data, neural networks performance can be significantly improved by working directly with seasonally adjusted levels.},

abstract = {Gridded global horizontal irradiance (GHI) databases are fundamental for analysing solar energy applications' technical and economic aspects, particularly photovoltaic applications. Today, there exist numerous gridded GHI databases whose quality has been thoroughly validated against ground-based irradiance measurements. Nonetheless, databases that generate data at latitudes above 65˚ are few, and those available gridded irradiance products, which are either reanalysis or based on polar orbiters, such as ERA5, COSMO-REA6, or CM SAF CLARA-A2, generally have lower quality or a coarser time resolution than those gridded irradiance products based on geostationary satellites. Amongst the high-latitude gridded GHI databases, the STRÅNG model developed by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) is likely the most accurate one, providing data across Sweden. To further enhance the product quality, the calibration technique called "site adaptation" is herein used to improve the STRÅNG dataset, which seeks to adjust a long period of low-quality gridded irradiance estimates based on a short period of high-quality irradiance measurements. This study introduces a novel approach for site adaptation of solar irradiance based on machine learning techniques, which differs from the conventional statistical methods used in previous studies. Seven machine-learning algorithms have been analysed and compared with conventional statistical approaches to identify Sweden's most accurate algorithms for site adaptation. Solar irradiance data gathered from three weather stations of SMHI is used for training and validation. The results show that machine learning can substantially improve the STRÅNG model's accuracy. However, due to the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in model performance, no universal machine learning model can be identified, which suggests that site adaptation is a location-dependant procedure.}

First, the problematic of using meteorological ground stations for the determining of solar dataset or time-series is addressed with the example of the French national meteorological network and the focus made on the South-West part of France: the heterogeneity in terms of spatial and temporal representativeness along with the relevance of the delivered measurement are questioned. Then, an innovative synthesis of 16 satellite-based ISS databases available so far is presented through the distribution of their corresponding features within three categories: spatial and temporal representativeness, data type in terms of component and format, and finally operating mode for the retrieving of the data in terms of price and accessibility. The results of this review shall help photovoltaic actors making the correlation between the available satellite-based databases and their specific needs.}

abstract = {Surface Solar Irradiance (SSI) is a key parameter dictating surface-atmosphere interactions, driving radiative, hydrological, and land surface processes, and can thus impinge greatly upon weather and climate. It is thereby a prerequisite of many studies and applications. Estimating SSI from satellites began in the 1960s, and is currently the principal way to map SSI spatiotemporal distributions from regional to global scales. Starting from an overview of historical studies carried out in the past several decades, this paper reviews the progresses made in methodology, validation, and products over these years. First, the requirements of SSI in various studies or applications are presented along with the theoretical background of SSI satellite estimation. Methods to estimate SSI from satellites are then summarized as well as their advantages and limitations. Validations of satellite-based SSI on two typical spatial scales are discussed followed by a brief description of existing products and their accuracies. Finally, the challenges faced by current SSI satellite estimation are analyzed, and possible improvements to implement in the future are suggested. This review not only updates the review paper by Pinker et al. (1995) on satellite methods to derive SSI but also offers a more comprehensive summary of the related studies and applications.}

abstract = {The province of Salta is characterized by its solar energy high potential. The use of solar resource would improve living conditions in the area, diversify the energy matrix, promote more sustainable production systems and reduce greenhouse gases emissions. However, there are only a few studies that describe in high spatial resolution the variability of the solar resource in Argentina. Multidimensional tools, that consider the environment and the socio-economic situation, have to be considered for adequate support decision-making, such as solar collector location assessment and photovoltaic potential. In this sense, a deep evaluation of the solar resource is needed first, as solar irradiation is an essential input variable for the design and evaluation of solar application systems. In this paper, we detail the methodology used to elaborate a GIS tool to support decisions related to renewable energy policies and solar technology design. A comparison between global solar irradiation measurements in situ, empirical models, and data provided by Land Surface Analysis Satellite Applications Facility (LSA-SAF), is performed in daily, monthly and annual basis for a seven-year period. This analysis validates the use of this satellite data for the determination of solar irradiation in the region.}

abstract = {A statistical model based on Tarpley’s original solar irradiation model is proposed and evaluated using data from seven new ground stations in Uruguay. The model estimates hourly global solar irradiation on a horizontal surface using GOES-East satellite images. We show that the introduction of a simple brightness dependence in the model parameters drastically improves the accuracy of the estimates. The implementations of the original and the improved models are explained in detail. For each case, the parameters are adjusted using controlled quality solar irradiation data and a comprehensive performance analysis, on an hourly and daily basis, is carried out using data from independent measurement sites. The relative RMS deviations for the estimates of the brightness-dependent model are 7.1% for the daily estimates and 14.0% for the hourly estimates, relative to the mean of the measurements. This represents a reduction of approximately 45% (daily) and 25% (hourly) in the relative RMS deviations of the original model. The improved model provides a good balance between simplicity and accuracy.}

The zonal average solar radiation is presented as monthly and annual averages for each 2.5° from 30°N to 30°S.

This value and satellite measurements of global albedo suggest that the most likely values for the global solar radiation terms are (in proportion to that intercepted by the earth) 0.29 reflected to space, 0.19 absorbed by the atmosphere, and 0.52 absorbed by the earth's surface.

  abstract  = {Forecasting solar energy generation is a challenging task because of the variety of solar power systems and weather regimes encountered. Inaccurate forecasts can result in substantial economic losses and power system reliability issues. One of the key challenges is the unavailability of a consistent and robust set of metrics to measure the accuracy of a solar forecast. This paper presents a suite of generally applicable and value-based metrics for solar forecasting for a comprehensive set of scenarios (i.e., different time horizons, geographic locations, and applications) that were developed as part of the U.S. Department of Energy SunShot Initiative’s efforts to improve the accuracy of solar forecasting. In addition, a comprehensive framework is developed to analyze the sensitivity of the proposed metrics to three types of solar forecasting improvements using a design-of-experiments methodology in conjunction with response surface, sensitivity analysis, and nonparametric statistical testing methods. The three types of forecasting improvements are (i) uniform forecasting improvements when there is not a ramp, (ii) ramp forecasting magnitude improvements, and (iii) ramp forecasting threshold changes. Day-ahead and 1-hour-ahead forecasts for both simulated and actual solar power plants are analyzed. The results show that the proposed metrics can efficiently evaluate the quality of solar forecasts and assess the economic and reliability impacts of improved solar forecasting. Sensitivity analysis results show that (i) all proposed metrics are suitable to show the changes in the accuracy of solar forecasts with uniform forecasting improvements, and (ii) the metrics of skewness, kurtosis, and Rényi entropy are specifically suitable to show the changes in the accuracy of solar forecasts with ramp forecasting improvements and a ramp forecasting threshold.},

abstract = {Tree boosting is a highly effective and widely used machine learning method. In this paper, we describe a scalable end-to-end tree boosting system called XGBoost, which is used widely by data scientists to achieve state-of-the-art results on many machine learning challenges. We propose a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree learning. More importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system. By combining these insights, XGBoost scales beyond billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems.},

In today’s increasingly digital financial landscape, the frequency and complexity of fraudulent activities are on the rise, posing significant risks and losses for both financial institutions and consumers. To effectively tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a machine learning-based K-means clustering method to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of financial fraud detection. By clustering vast amounts of financial transaction data, we can identify anomalous patterns and behaviors in a timely manner, thereby detecting potential fraud. Compared to traditional rule-based detection methods, machine learning-based approaches better adapt to ever-evolving fraud techniques and patterns while improving flexibility and precision in detection. Moreover, K-means clustering also aids in optimizing resource allocation within financial institutions by enabling focused monitoring and prevention efforts in high-risk areas, thus effectively mitigating the impact of fraud on the overall financial system. In summary, the machine learning-based K-means clustering method holds promising prospects for application in the field of financial fraud detection as it strives to establish a more secure and reliable transaction environment for the finance industry.

Intelligent manufacturing has gradually become an important development trend in the industrial field. As an artificial intelligence technology, machine vision has been widely used in the field of automation. This paper discusses the development and application of robot arm intelligent picking system based on machine vision in the field of intelligent manufacturing. The system converts the target into the image signal through the image acquisition device, and sends it to the special image processing system for digital processing. Then, the image system performs various operations on the signal to extract the features of the target, and controls the action of the field equipment according to the discriminating results. With machine vision technology as the core, the system realizes automatic picking tasks and improves production efficiency and quality.

abstract = {A novel automatic filtering methodology is proposed for 1-min GHI and DIF data using surface measurements obtained at five sites located in various climate zones of Argentina. The methodology contemplates DIF information obtained through the use of a shadowband or shading ring instead of the shading ball that requires a solar tracker. Three different flags are presented for suspicious or erroneous data identified by the filters of the methodology, which respond to the weight or strictness of the corresponding filter. The methodology uses filters established in the literature and proposes new filters capable of identifying slight misalignments of the shadowband as well as measurements below a minimum threshold empirically established for heavily overcast or thunderstorm conditions. A statistical analysis based on data obtained at a high-quality reference station and the modification of a pre-existing methodology is also presented. In general terms and at all sites, it is observed that the total amount of suspicious data increases significantly as the solar zenith angle increases. Overall, the methodology is able to identify and flag 15.0–44.6% erroneous or suspicious values, depending on site. The proposed methodology is applicable at any world station where the global and diffuse irradiance components are both measured.}

abstract = {This study discusses solar irradiance variability in the spatial and temporal domains for the active use of solar energy. The spatial domain was calculated using the difference between one location and another in a focused small tile area. The principal component analysis (PCA) was used for this analysis in the spatial and temporal domain. The Umbrella Effect Index (UI) was calculated to determine the probability of an umbrella effect event within a specific time range. This study discusses solar irradiance variability using solar irradiance data analyzed every 10 min from high-temporal observations of geostationary satellites in the Asia-Pacific region. This study shows that solar heterogeneity around the Asia-Pacific ranges from 0–135 W/m2 with a high tendency in the area around the equator and highlands. In addition, this study also shows that the Asia Pacific region has umbrella effect events of approximately 50–2224 h/year with an index ranging approximately 0–0.34. This study presents the annual analysis and seasonal trends of solar irradiance variability over the entire study area. Determining seasonal trends is important because electricity demand fluctuates significantly as seasons progress. An integrated analysis of heterogeneity and UI revealed trends in spatiotemporal variations in solar irradiance. This approach provides useful information for optimizing and managing the locations for installing solar power plants. Moreover, an evaluation of existing solar power plants is presented. Evaluations based on spatiotemporal data reveal impossible characteristics using traditional approaches that use long-term simple averages or typical solar irradiance data. This research shows the distributed photovoltaic (PV) system in wide area can increase the stability of solar energy supply to the grid.}
